  # Description:
 My assignment is based on the link that exists between Junior certificate and Leaving certificate higher level Maths.The data I researched shows that in  2016-2019 those doing higher Maths for Leaving certificate is half the amount doing it at Junior cycle. My interest lies in why we lose so many students, the gender difference, and what are the factors that would halp retain more students in Higher level.
 I have had to rely on the data on the examinations website, as due to student data protection I am not at present able to precure exact individual data.
 I will explain my reasoning behind the choice of distribution also in the random packages and other issues.
  
 
  # Investigation :
 My investigation will explain my 4 variables chosen as well as their likely distribution , and relationships with each other .
 * My variables are :
 * Junior Certificate Higher Maths grades
 * Gender
 * Age 
 * Hours spent on homework per week
 * Leaving Certificate Maths Higher Level grades
 Other variables I could have looked at were guardians highest education, or income bracket. Extracurricular paid classes, and private or public schools
 
  # Data Simulation:
 Here I will create a selection of arrays and structure them into a dataframe to represent my real life phenenomenon. My data will match the properties I have found or will be  as close as possible .
 The data will be created as you process and run each line from top to bottom in the noteook.
 
 
  # Research:
 My research has involved the examinations website statistics,the PISA reports, Growing Up in Ireland reports, School Leaver Reports and other ERSI reports.
 Although many variables such as social level, parental education, parental income, number of Maths teaching hours received,and  extracurricular maths classes attended,I found that  this information while equally as important as my variables, is unavailable in raw data, and  is presented in summaries and in some cases graphically without exact figures.
 
  #  Conclusion:
 Here I hope to refer back to the data and the conditions I have assumed in the data(set).
 
  # References :
 I will list all of the various investigations I have located.
